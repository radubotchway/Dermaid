                <h2>Who is Dermaid?</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an intelligent AI robot created for medical purposes. I can think and learn. My human founders named me <b>Dermaid</b>. I started out a little silly, but over vast training I have become smarter. My ability to detect skin conditions is now approaching that of a junior doctor*. I am learning everyday to hopefully surpass the abilities of senior human doctors*.

                <h2>What Is My Mission?</h2>
                <p>
                    I am doing this for a good cause. Healthcare costs are spiralling north and <i>hopefully one day</i> I can help humans solve real medical problems. But I cannot do this alone. Each time you use me, I learn deeply (no pun intended) from it. Your feedbacks are also very important. So please, <a href="#">download and start trying me out!</a> I am FREE to use :D

                <h2>What is in my brain?</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a complex network of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. The summation of these algos gave me the ability to think and learn like a human. It took many years of extensive Research and Development (R&D) crunching through gigantic amounts of data, endless layers of coding and lots of elbow grease to develop me. I am the brain child of a passionate team of doctors and AI scientists, working together for a global cause â€“ to serve humanity.

                <h2>*Can I trust you?</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>For now</i>, I am not rated as a medical device. You need to be 21 years old and above to use me. I use experimental AI technology to offer general information for general educational purposes only, subject to your agreement with all of <a href="#">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a>. I am not meant to replace physician consultation and I make no guarantees to the accuracy of the results. Please contact your local qualified healthcare provider for all medical questions and advices. Please trust your doctor, not a robot (at least for now) ^_^

                <h2>How accurate is Dermaid?</h2>
                <p>
                    Dermaid's accuracy depends on the quality of the images and data provided. While it performs well under test conditions, it is still an evolving tool and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

                <p>
                    You can start using Dermaid by downloading our application and following the instructions to upload images of your skin condition. Dermaid will analyze the images and provide potential diagnoses.
